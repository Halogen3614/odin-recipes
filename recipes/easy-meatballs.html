    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My husband makes these easy meatballs with simple ingredients like eggs, panko bread crumbs, garlic powder, and fresh basil; they come out flavorful and delicious every time! Kids love them, too!</p>
    <p>If desired, add the cooked meatballs to your favorite sauce until submerged (this brings out the moistness).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>Â½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, Italian seasoning, basil, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Add ground beef and panko bread crumbs; mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Shape beef mixture into about 40 meatballs (1 1/2-inch in size, a little smaller than golf balls) using a teaspoon. Place on ungreased, rimmed baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the centers, 10 to 15 minutes total, turning halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
