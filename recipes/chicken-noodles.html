    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These slow cooker Asian zing chicken noodles are amazing—so much flavor with so little effort. Chicken thighs, slow-cooked in sweet spicy chili-soy-ginger zing sauce, are shredded and tossed with quick-cooking fresh lo mein noodles.</p>
    <p>If your comfort food tends to the spicy, this is for you.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) jar Buffalo Wild Wings® Asian Zing Sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh lo mein noodles</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, sliced, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken thighs into a slow cooker. Pour sauce over chicken and cover with the lid. Cook on Low until chicken is very tender, about 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Use two forks to shred chicken into large chunks.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add noodles and cook until tender with a bite, 40 seconds to 3 minutes, or according to package directions; drain. Place prepared lo mein into the crockpot with chicken and toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve with freshly sliced green onions.</li>
    </ol>
